Description: This algorithm is described in detail in the paper "Hedging Forecast Combinations With an Application to the Random Forest" by Beck et al. (2024) <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5032102>. The package provides a function hedgedrf() that can be used to train a Hedged Random Forest model on a dataset, and a function predict.hedgedrf() that can be used to make predictions with the model.
