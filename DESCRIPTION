Description: An implementation of the Hedged Random Forest algorithm. The algorithm is described in detail in the paper "Hedging Forecast Combinations With an Application to the Random Forest" by Beck et al. (2023) <arXiv:2308.15384>. The package provides a function `hedgedrf` that can be used to train a Hedged Random Forest model on a dataset, and a function `predict.hedgedrf` that can be used to make predictions with the model.
